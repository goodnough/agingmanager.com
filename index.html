    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In the fall of 2001, John Reagan grew increasingly anxious about his elderly parents, who had lived in their
        house at 1838 Jenifer St. since 1959. "Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and my mom was unable to get up
        and down stairs, and we had a concern about her falling," Reagan said.  Reagan, 44, was their only son. He lived
        170 miles north in Eau Claire, which meant he couldn't just run over to Jenifer Street if his mother, Florence,
        and father, Joe, needed help.  "We knew something had to be done, but we had no idea what to do," he said.
